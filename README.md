# Tic Tac Toe in React

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.
[Check Out the Live Version](https://shivam-plays-tictactoe.netlify.app)

## Features

- **Two Players**: The game allows two players to take turns.
- **3x3 Grid Layout**: The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid using CSS Grid.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The board updates dynamically with each player's move.
- **X and O Icons**: The game uses custom icons for X and O, making the gameplay visually appealing.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game is a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game board, and a confirmation popup will ask for confirmation before resetting.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-react.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-react
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
 ```
3. **Start the Development Server**:
```bash
npm start
 ```
The app will run in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

## Reset Button Confirmation

**When the Reset button is clicked, a confirmation popup will appear, asking for confirmation before resetting the game.**
**Clicking OK will proceed with resetting the game board.**
**Clicking Cancel will close the popup without resetting the game.**
**This ensures that the game is not accidentally reset, preserving the current board state until the user confirms the action.**

## Future Enhancements

**AI Opponent: Add a feature to play against the computer.**
**Score Tracking: Implement a score tracking system to keep track of wins, losses, and draws.**
